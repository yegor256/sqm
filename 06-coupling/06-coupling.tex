  [Glenford Myers]

  {Coupling is the measure of the strength of association established by a connection from one module to another. Strong coupling \ul{complicates} a system since a module is harder to \ul{understand}, \ul{change}, or \ul{correct} by itself if it is highly interrelated with other modules. Complexity can be reduced by designing systems with the weakest possible coupling between modules.}

  [Wayne P. Stevens]
  {wayne-stevens}
  {The degree of coupling established by a particular connection is a function of several factors, and thus it is \ul{difficult to establish} a simple index of coupling. Coupling depends (1)~on how complicated the connection is, (2)~on whether the connection refers to the module itself or something inside it, and (3)~on what is being sent or received.}

\lnThought{Software experts agree.}

\lnQuote
  [Grady Booch]
  {grady-booch}
  {However, there is tension between the concepts of coupling and inheritance because inheritance introduces significant coupling. On the one hand, weakly coupled classes are desirable; on the other hand, inheritance---which \ul{tightly couples} superclasses and their subclasses---helps us to exploit the commonality among abstractions.}
  {booch1994object}

\lnQuote
  [Martin Fowler]
  {martin-fowler}
  {The biggest problems come from uncontrolled coupling at the \ul{upper levels}. I don't worry about the number of modules coupled together, but I look at the pattern of \ul{dependency relationship} between the modules.}
  {fowler2001}

\lnQuote
  {david-west}
  {Collaborations always involve some degree of coupling between both parties of the collaboration, so the \ul{number of collaborations} should be minimized to the greatest extent possible.}
  {west2004object}

\lnQuote
  {robert-martin}
  {The lack of coupling means that the elements of our system are \ul{better isolated} from each other and from change. This isolation makes it easier to \ul{understand} each element of the system.}
  {martin2008clean}

\lnQuote
  [Steve Freeman]
  {steve-freeman}
  {Elements are coupled if a change in one \ul{forces} a change in the other. Loosely coupled features are easier to \ul{maintain}.}

\lnThought{Measuring coupling is difficult, but possible.}

  {\ul{Coupling Between Objects (CBO)} --- for a class is a count of the number of other classes to which it is coupled.}
  {chidamber1994metrics}

\lnQuote
  [Fernando Brito e Abreu]
  {fernando-brito-e-abreu}
  {Coupling Factor (COF) has a very high positive correlation with all quality measures. Therefore, as coupling among classes increases, the defect density and normalized rework are also expected to increase. This result shows that coupling in software systems has a strong negative impact on software quality and therefore should be kept to the minimum required during design.}
  {brito1996evaluating}

\lnQuote
  {../06-coupling/dcc}
  {\ul{Direct Class Coupling (DCC)} --- this metric is a count of the different number of classes that a class is directly related to. The metric includes classes that are directly related by attribute declarations and message passing (parameters) in methods.}
  {bansiya2002}

\lnQuote
  [Steve McConnell]
  {steve-mcconnell}
  {Low-to-medium \ul{fan-out} means having a given class use a low-to-medium number of other classes. High fan-out (more than about seven) indicates that a class uses a large number of other classes and may therefore be overly complex. High \ul{fan-in} refers to having a high number of classes that use a given class. High fan-in implies that a system has been designed to make good use of utility classes at the lower levels in the system.}

  [Derek Comartin]
  {derek-comartin}
  {Afferent coupling (denoted by \textbf{\textsf{Ca}}) is a metric that indicates the total number of other projects/boundaries that are dependent upon it. Efferent coupling (denoted by \textbf{\textsf{Ce}}) is another metric that is the verse of Afferent Coupling. It is the total number of projects that a given project depends on. Instability another metric that is a ratio: $\textbf{\textsf{I}} = \textbf{\textsf{Ce}} / (\textbf{\textsf{Ce}} + \textbf{\textsf{Ca}}).$ This metric is a ratio between 0 and 1. With 0 meaning it's totally stable and 1 meaning it's unstable.}

\lnThought{Different types of coupling exist.}

\lnPitch{
  \pptBanner{Types of Coupling (some of them)}
  \begin{pptWide}{2}
  \scriptsize\begin{itemize}
  \item \ul{Content Coupling} is when one module modifies or relies on the internal workings of another module (e.g., accessing local data of another module).
  \item \ul{Global Coupling} is when two modules share the same global data (e.g., a global variable).
  \item \ul{External Coupling} occurs when two modules share an externally imposed data format, communication protocol, or device interface.
  \item \ul{Control Coupling} is one module controlling the flow of another, by passing it information on what to do (e.g., passing a what-to-do flag).
  \item \ul{Stamp Coupling} is when modules share a composite data structure and use only a part of it, possibly a different part (e.g., passing a whole record to a function that only needs one field of it).
  \item \ul{Data Coupling} is when modules share data through, for example, parameters. Each datum is an elementary piece, and these are the only data shared (e.g., passing an integer to a function that computes a square root).
  \item \ul{Message Coupling} can be achieved by state decentralization (as in objects) and component communication is done via parameters or message passing (see Message passing).
  \item \ul{Subclass Coupling} describes the relationship between a child and its parent. The child is connected to its parent, but the parent isn't connected to the child.
  \item \ul{Temporal Coupling} is when two actions are bundled together into one module just because they happen to occur at the same time.
