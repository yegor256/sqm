  {fred-brooks}
  {The total \ul{cost of maintaining} a widely used program is typically 40 percent or more of the cost of developing it.}
  {brooks1978mythical}

  {It is a truism that \ul{good} software is easy to \ul{maintain}.}
  {hamlet1997}

\lnQuote
  [Ward Cunningham]
  {ward-cunningham}
  {Shipping first time code is like going into \ul{debt}. A little debt speeds development so long as it is paid back promptly with a rewrite. The danger occurs when the debt is not repaid. Every minute spent on not-quite-right code counts as interest on that debt.}
  {cunningham1992}

\lnQuote

  {anonymous}
  {Before developers can claim that they are building maintainable systems, there must be some way to \ul{measure} maintainability}
  {coleman1994}

\lnQuote
  {paper-1}
  {The factors of software that determine or influence maintainability can be organized into a \ul{hierarchical} structure of measurable attribute. Our hierarchy serves as a taxonomic definition for software maintainability that is compatible with the 35 published works upon which it is based.}

  ``Approximately 50 regression models were constructed in an attempt to identify simple models that could be calculated from existing tools and still be generic enough to apply to a wide range of software systems.

  {We are convinced that Maintainability Index is \ul{nonsense}. We think that it is not sensible to reduce the maintainability of a whole software system to one single indicator.}

  \pptThought{``The Maintainability Index does not provide information about the impact on development activities. A value of 57 does not express which maintainability aspects are affected by a bad value.'' --- Rainer Niedermayr}}

  {If you are a researcher, \ul{think twice} before using the maintainability index in your experiments. Make sure you study and fully understand the original papers published about it.}

  {tim-gilboy}
  {If we're going to use the Maintainability Index we should use it to measure \ul{relative} maintainability within our project rather than use it as an \ul{absolute} metric.}
