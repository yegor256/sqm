\lnThought{Quality of code means \ul{maintainability}: how quickly other programmers can understand your code.}

\lnQuote
  {edsger-dijkstra}
  {It has been suggested that there is some law of nature telling us that the amount of intellectual effort needed grows with the \ul{square} of program \ul{length}. But, thank goodness, no one has been able to prove this law. And this is because it \ul{need not be true}.}
  {dijkstra1972humble}

\lnQuote
  {fred-brooks}
  {A programmer depends upon other people's programs. These are often \ul{maldesigned}, \ul{poorly implemented}, \ul{incompletely delivered} (no source code or test cases), and \ul{poorly documented}. So he must spend hours studying and fixing things that in an \ul{ideal world} would be complete, available, and usable.}
  {brooks1978mythical}

\lnQuote
  {lionel-deimel}
  {One of the most overlooked programming skills is the ability to \ul{read} a program, an activity the programmer is called upon to do with surprising \ul{frequency}.}
  {deimel1985uses}

\lnQuote
  {../01-lines-of-code/darrell-raymond}
  {Whatever approach is used, it is clear that a central activity in software maintenance is \ul{reading}. In maintenance, the main role of source code is not as a compilable entity, but as a human-readable statement of the intent and mechanism of the program.}
  {raymond1991reading}

\lnQuote
  {harold-abelson}
  {We want to establish the idea that a computer language is not just a way of getting a computer to perform operations but rather that it is a novel \ul{formal medium} for expressing ideas about methodology. Thus, programs must be written for people to read, and only \ul{incidentally} for machines to execute.}
  {abelson1996structure}

\lnQuote
  {robert-martin}
  {Indeed, the ratio of time spent reading vs. writing is well over 10:1. We are constantly reading old code as part of the effort to write new code. Because this ratio is so high, we want the \ul{reading} of code to be easy, even if it makes the \ul{writing} harder.}
  {martin2008clean}

\lnQuote
  [Dustin Boswell]
  {dustin-boswell}
  {Code should be written to minimize the \ul{time} it would take for someone else to understand it. It's so important that we call it The Fundamental Theorem of Readability.}
  {boswell2011art}

\lnThought{Everybody wants higher \ul{quality of code}, but nobody knows how to measure it.}

\lnQuote
  {shari-lawrence-pfleeger}
  {It's not enough to make claims about your software; you must support your claims with \ul{measurable evidence}.}
  {pfleeger2008software}

\lnQuote
  [Mariza A. S. Bigonha]
  {mariza-bigonha}
  {The application of \ul{thresholds} could lower the cost of software quality evaluation since they can reduce the amount of software code that should be inspected. Therefore, the thresholds provide a way for quantitative and qualitative evaluations to complement each other, leading to a more efficient quality \ul{assessment} of object-oriented software systems.}

  To evaluate our catalog, in that work, we handled a case study to assess proprietary software from a public organization with a bad internal quality to verify the proposed thresholds' ability to indicate it.\par

\lnThought{Size of code is the key contributor to its quality, while Lines of Code (LoC) is the basic measurement of size.}

\lnQuote
  {steve-mcconnell}
  {Studies have found that larger routines are more \ul{error-prone} than smaller ones. Keeping routines short helps reduce errors and makes the code easier to maintain.}
  {mcconnell2004code}

\lnQuote
  {robert-martin}
  {The first rule of functions is that they should be \ul{small}. The second rule of functions is that they should be even \ul{smaller} than that.}
  {martin2008clean}

\lnQuote
  {hongyu-zhang}
  {Our results show that LOC can be a useful indicator of software quality, and that we are able to build useful defect prediction models using LOC.}
  {zhang2009investigation}

\lnThought{It \ul{may} be wrong to measure productivity of a programmer by counting lines of code, but for the quality of code the LoC metric is a perfect indicator.}

\lnThought{In 2011, Uncle Bob \href{https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/66523}{suggested} that 200 lines per Java class is a good guideline to stay below.}

  ``We conclude that code size is not a good predictor of testing effort (measured by allocated test engineers) at either product or product line levels. Other metrics, like code coupling and cohesion are more appropriate for such estimation.''\par

\lnThought{Instead of counting lines, it may be more reasonable to count NCSS (Non Commenting Source Statements), but not always.}
