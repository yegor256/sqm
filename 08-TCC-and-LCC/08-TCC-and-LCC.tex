  {socrates}
  {\textbf{Socrates}: I am a lover of these processes of \ul{division} and \ul{bringing together}, as aids to speech and thought; and if I think any other man is able to see things that can naturally be collected into one and divided into many, him I follow after and walk in his footsteps as if he were a god.}

  {Module cohesion may be conceptualized as the \ul{cement} that holds the processing elements of a module together. In a sense, a high degree of module cohesion is an indication of \ul{close approximation} of inherent problem structure.}

  {../08-TCC-and-LCC/paper}
  {If a class is designed in \ul{ad hoc manner} and unrelated components are included in the class, the class represents more than one concept and does not \ul{model an entity}. The cohesion value of such a class is likely to be less than 0.5.}

  [Steve McConnell]
  {steve-mcconnell}
  {Cohesion refers to how closely all the routines in a class or all the code in a routine support a \ul{central purpose}---how focused the class is. The ideas of \ul{abstraction} and cohesion are closely related---a class interface that presents a good abstraction usually has strong cohesion.}
