  {Dead code is code that has been used in the past, but is currently never executed. Dead code \ul{hinders} code \ul{comprehension} and makes the current program structure \ul{less obvious}.}

  {Our survey results show that engineers at Google strongly prefer our monolithic repo, and that \ul{visibility} of the codebase and simple \ul{dependency management} were the primary factors for this preference.}
  {jaspan2018advantages}

\lnPitch{\pptBanner{Monolithic Repositories}
  {\small\begin{description}
  \item[Centralization]
    {\scriptsize The codebase is contained in a single repo encompassing multiple projects.}
  \item[Visibility]
    {\scriptsize Code is viewable and searchable by all engineers in the organization.}
  \item[Synchronization:]
    {\scriptsize The development process is trunk-based; engineers commit to the head of the repo.}
  \item[Completeness]
    {\scriptsize Any project in the repo can be built only from dependencies also checked into the repo.
    Dependencies are unversioned; projects must use whatever version of their dependency is at the repo head.}
  \item[Standardization]
    {\scriptsize A shared set of tooling governs how engineers interact with the code, including building, testing, browsing, and reviewing code.}

\lnPitch{\pptBanner{Benefits of ``Manyrepo'' Approach}
  {\small\begin{description}
  \item[Encapsulation]
    Each repo encapsulates and hides its details from everybody else.
  \item[Fast Builds]
    When a repo is small, the time its automated build takes is small.
  \item[Accurate Metrics]
    Calculating LoC for a large repository doesn't make any sense.
  \item[Homogeneous Tasks]
    It's easier to make tasks similar in size and complexity.
  \item[Single Coding Standard]
    Smaller repositories look more beautiful.
  \item[Short Names]
    Smaller namespaces mean better maintainability.
  \item[Simple Tests]
    More dependencies are difficult to mock and test.
