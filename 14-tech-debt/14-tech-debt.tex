\lnTitlePage{14}{24}{pvZDcytPU3w}

\lnQuote
  [Ward Cunningham]
  {ward-cunningham}
  {Shipping first time code is like going into \ul{debt}. A little debt speeds development so long as it is paid back promptly with a rewrite. The danger occurs when the debt is not repaid. Every minute spent on not-quite-right code counts as \ul{interest} on that debt.}
  {cunningham1992}

\lnThought{Technical debt may hurt if it's not managed earlier rather than never.}

\lnQuote
  [Martin Fowler]
  {martin-fowler}
  {You can bear some interest payments, but if the payments become too great, you will be overwhelmed. It is important to manage your debt, paying parts of it off by means of \ul{refactoring}.}
  {fowler1999refactoring}

\lnQuote
  [Philippe Kruchten]
  {philippe-kruchten}
  {By identifying concrete items of technical debt, considering their impact over time, evaluating the lifecycle costs associated with them, and introducing mechanisms for expressing technical debt and estimating its impact, an organization can help everyone better understand the \ul{pains} of software evolution.}
  {kruchten2019managing}

\lnQuote
  [Mark Seemann]
  {mark-seemann}
  {I like the gardening metaphor's emphasis on activities that combat disorder. Just as you must prune and weed a \ul{garden}, you must refactor and pay off technical debt in your code bases.}
  {seemann2021code}

\lnQuote
  [Neil Ernst]
  {neil-ernst}
  {Debt is not, by itself, the problem. The problem is not identifying and \ul{acknowledging} the debt, not \ul{measuring} the debt, and not \ul{paying} the debt back.}
  {ernst2021technical}

\lnThought{Scientifically, it's proven too.}

\lnQuote
  [Emad Shihab]
  {emad-shihab}
  {We find that developers with higher experience tend to introduce most of the \ul{self-admitted} technical debt (SATD) and that time pressures and complexity of the code do not correlate with the amount of self-admitted technical debt.}
  {potdar2014exploratory}

\lnQuote
  [Gabriele Bavota]
  {gabriele-bavota}
  {57\% of fixed instances shows a very long survivability, by staying in the system for \ul{over 1,000 commits}, on average.}
  {bavota2016large}

\lnQuote
  [Terese Besker]
  {terese-besker}
  {Our results indicate that technical debt reduces developers' \ul{morale} since it hinders them from performing their development tasks, making progress, and achieving their goals.}
  {besker2020influence}

\lnQuote
  [Paris Avgeriou]
  {paris-avgeriou}
  {There is no commonly agreed on and validated set of rules and metrics for measuring technical debt. Instead, each tool uses its own set of rules and metrics without detailed explanation or motivation.}
  {avgeriou2020overview}

\lnQuote
  [Yutaro Kashiwa]
  {yutaro-kashiwa}
  {We found that changes involving SATD are 6–7\% less likely to be accepted by reviews than those not involving SATD. About 28–48\% of SATD comments are introduced during reviewing. We found that 20\% of SATD comments are introduced due to reviewer request.}
  {kashiwa2022empirical}

\lnThought{Now, the Puzzle Driven Development!}

\lnQuote
  [Eric Allman]
  {eric-allman}
  {Technical debt is inevitable. The issue is not eliminating debt, but rather managing it. When a project starts, the team almost never has a full grasp on the totality of the problem.}
  {allman2012managing}

\lnQuote
  [Giancarlo Succi]
  {giancarlo-succi}
  {This paper presents the benefits of considering the entire backlog when prioritizing tasks. We employ an iterative approach using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to optimize a linear model with various preprocessing methods to determine the optimal model
for task prioritization within a backlog.}
