\lnThought{A properly written program doesn't need comments, or maybe it does?}

  [Brian Kernighan]
  {brian-kernighan}
  {The best documentation for a computer program is a \ul{clean structure}. It also helps if the code is well formatted, with good mnemonic identifiers, labels, and a smattering of \ul{enlightening comments}. Flowcharts and program descriptions are of secondary importance; the only reliable documentation of a computer program is the \ul{code} itself.}

  ``Comments which precede a group of statements, and which describe them in terms of operations in another domain, will be particularly helpful. The role of comments is to \ul{bridge} between knowledge domains.''

  [Hubert E. Dunsmore]
  {hubert-dunsmore}
  {An experiment was conducted to investigate how comments are related to programmers' ability to \ul{understand} programs. Those programmers whose programs contained comments were able to \ul{answer} more questions than those without comments.}

\lnQuote
  [David Parnas]
  {david-parnas}
  {Documentation that seems \ul{clear} and \ul{adequate} to its authors is often about \ul{as clear as mud} to the programmer who must maintain the code six months or \ul{six years later}.}

  [Martin Fowler]
  {martin-fowler}
  {Don't worry, we aren't saying that people shouldn't write comments. In our olfactory analogy, comments aren't a bad smell; indeed they are a \ul{sweet smell}. The reason we mention comments here is that comments often are used as a \ul{deodorant}. It's surprising how often you look at thickly commented code and notice that the comments are there because the code is bad.}
  {fowler1999refactoring}

\lnQuote
  [Andy Hunt]
  {andy-hunt}
  {Programmers are taught: good code has \ul{lots of comments}. Unfortunately, they are never taught why code needs comments: bad code requires lots of comments. The DRY principle tells us to keep the low-level knowledge in the code, where it belongs, and reserve the comments for other, \ul{high-level explanations}. Otherwise, we're duplicating knowledge, and every change means changing both the code and the comments. The comments will inevitably become \ul{out of date}, and untrustworthy comments are worse than no comments at all.}

\lnQuote

  {eriko-nurvitadhi}
  {The results indicated that method comments do increase \ul{low-level} program understanding, while class comments did not increase \ul{high-level} understanding. This raises questions about the role of class comments in Object-Oriented programs...}
  {nurvitadhi2003class}

\lnQuote
  [Steve McConnell]
  {steve-mcconnell}
  {The main contributor to code-level documentation isn't comments, but good \ul{programming style}... Comments are easier to write poorly than well, and commenting can be more \ul{damaging} than helpful.}
  {mcconnell2004code}

\lnQuote
  [Beat Fluri]
  {beat-fluri}
  {Code and comments \ul{rarely} co-evolve: despite its growth rate, newly added code barely is commented. Also, 97\% of comment changes are done in the same revision as the associated source code change.}
  {fluri2007code}

\lnQuote
  [Robert C. Martin]
  {robert-martin}
  {Indeed, comments are, at best, a \ul{necessary evil}. If our programming languages were expressive enough, or if we had the talent to subtly wield those languages to express our intent, we would not need comments very much---perhaps \ul{not at all}.}
  {martin2008clean}

\lnQuote
  [Tobias Röhm]
  {tobias-roehm}
  {Source code is \ul{more trusted} than documentation: 21 participants reported that they get their main information from \ul{source code} and \ul{inline comments} whereas only four stated that \ul{documentation} is their main source of information.}
  {roehm2012professional}

\lnQuote
  [Mark Seemann]
  {mark-seemann}
  {Comments may deteriorate as the code evolves around them. What was once a correct comment becomes \ul{misleading} as time passes. Ultimately, the only artefact you can \ul{trust} is the code. Not the comments in the code, but the actual instructions and expressions that are compiled to working software.}
  {seemann2021code}

\lnThought{We can measure the amount of comments in a code base.}

\lnQuote
  {../05-maintainability-index/paper-1}
  {[The degree of] \ul{intramodule commenting} is the number of lines with comments divided by the total number of lines in the module, averaged over all modules.}
  {oman1992metrics}

\lnQuote
  [Oliver Arafat]
  {oliver-arafat}
  {Comment density is the percentage of comment lines in a given source code base, that is, comment lines divided by total lines of code. Comment density is assumed to be a good \ul{predictor} of maintainability and hence \ul{survival} of a software project. In this study we focus on one particular code metric, the comment density, and assess it across 5,229 active open source projects, representing about 30\% of all active open source projects.}

  {We defined a taxonomy of comments to guide this analysis. Our study showed that programmers comment \ul{some constructs} more often than others. In the majority of cases, comments are intended to \ul{explain} the code that follows them. The second more widely used category of comments are dedicated to \ul{communication} between programmers and personal notes (we call them \ul{working} comments).}

  \item If you can't write a \ul{clear} comment, there may be a problem with the code.
  \item Comments should dispel \ul{confusion}, not cause it.
  \item Explain \ul{unidiomatic} code in comments.
  \item Provide links to the original source of \ul{copied} code.
  \item Include \ul{links} to external references where they will be most helpful.
  \item Add comments when \ul{fixing} bugs.
