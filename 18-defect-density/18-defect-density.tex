  {Scatter plots for executable lines per module versus the number of errors found in the module were graphed. It was difficult to see any trend within these plots, so \ul{the number of errors/1000 executable lines} within a module size was calculated.}

  ``One \ul{surprising} result was that module \ul{size} did not account for error proneness. In fact, it was quite the contrary---the larger the module, the \ul{less} error prone it was. This was true even though the larger modules were more complex.''\par

If the value is low compared to similar past projects, the inspection process should be examined. If the inspection process is found to be adequate, it should then be concluded that the development process has resulted in a \ul{relatively defect-free} product.''

\lnThought{Defect Density (DD), as a metric, can be predicted and even planned for.}

\lnQuote
  [Harlan D. Mills]
  {harlan-mills}
  {While our experience in applying statistical quality-control techniques to software development is limited, initial experience indicates that \ul{five fixes per thousand lines of code} can be tolerated without invalidating the application of statistics to estimate MTTF. This failure rate is low compared to normal development practices, where \ul{20 to 60} fixes per thousand lines of code is \ul{not atypical}.}

  {The analysis showed a \ul{significantly higher} density of defects during requirements inspections. It was also observed, that the defect densities found \ul{decreased} exponentialy as the more products approached the coding phase.}

  {Five out of the six object-oriented metrics presented by \citet{chidamber1994metrics} appear to be useful to predict class \ul{fault-proneness} during the high- and low-level design phases of the life-cycle.}

  [Norman Fenton]
  {norman-fenton}
  {Our critical review of state-of-the-art of models for predicting software defects has shown that many methodological and theoretical \ul{mistakes} have been made... We recommend holistic models for software defect prediction, using Bayesian Belief Networks, as alternative approaches to the single-issue models used at present.}

  [Steve McConnell]
  {steve-mcconnell}
  {Industry average experience is about 1-25 errors per 1000 lines of code for delivered software. Cases that have one-tenth as many errors as this are rare; cases that have 10 times more tend not to be reported. (They probably aren't ever completed!) Microsoft experiences about 10â€“20 defects per 1000 lines of code during in-house testing and 0.5 defects per 1000 lines of code in released product.}

\lnThought{Defect density depends on many factors and metrics.}

\lnQuote
  [Parastoo Mohagheghi]
  {parastoo-mohagheghi}
  {The analysis showed that \ul{reused} components have lower defect-density than \ul{non-reused} ones. Reused components have more defects with highest severity than the total distribution, but less defects after delivery.}

  {nachiappan-nagappan}
  {A case study performed on Windows Server 2003 indicates the validity of the relative \ul{code churn} measures as early indicators of system \ul{defect density}. Our code churn metric suite is able to discriminate between fault and not fault-prone binaries with an accuracy of 89\%.}
  {nagappan2005use}

\lnQuote
  [Thomas Ball]
  {thomas-ball}
  {Our results show that the \ul{static analysis} defect density is correlated at statistically significant levels to the \ul{pre-release} defect density determined by various testing activities. Further, the static analysis defect density can be used to predict the pre-release defect density with a high degree of sensitivity.}

\lnQuote
  [A G{\"u}ne{\c{s}} Koru]
  {gunes-koru}
  {We studied four large-scale object-oriented products, Mozilla, Cn3d, JBoss, and Eclipse. We observed that defect proneness increased as class size increased, but at a \ul{slower} rate; smaller classes were proportionally more problematic than larger classes.}
  {koru2008investigation}

\lnQuote
  [Kazuhiro Yamashita]
  {kazuhiro-yamashita}
  {Although we found some support for findings in recent literature that \ul{smaller files} have higher defects density, we found further evidence that \ul{very large} or \ul{complex} files have lower defect densities and in some cases even lower defect proneness. Our findings have immediate practical implications: the redistribution of Java code into smaller and less complex files may be \ul{counterproductive}.}
